  <h3>Why Enejistats Exists</h3>
  <p>
    Across Nigeria and many parts of Africa, thousands of talented footballers remain unseen by the professional world — 
    not because they lack skill, but because they lack visibility. Traditional scouting is limited, and most grassroots players 
    have no structured way to present their match performance, career growth, or stats in a standardized and trusted format.

  <h3>Addressing Talent Underservice</h3>
  <p>
    Most players at the grassroots level have little or no access to professional analytics, scouting reports, or even digital 
    performance records. Clubs and scouts often work blindly, lacking data-driven insight into emerging talent. 
    Players, in turn, miss out on opportunities due to outdated systems and disconnected ecosystems.
